#Personal time log.

##reviewing previous classes trying to find things that I do not yet fully understand and would want clarification from google or someone else from.

Review making a repository and all relevant elements like readme and .gitignore.

start reading more in terms of the third element that was not necesarily included yet being the Licensing.

>Start making sense of legal implications of no licence
>and understanding the importance of having a form of licence on your project
>lest you become the nobody that is included in a project where you would accept other collaborators.
>Basically meaning that if there is someone helping in your project and you don't have a licence
>that if they do something with the stuff they could exclude you from using your own work so they do the actual licensing.
>This is also considered a bit of a richard-move in some cultures.

>https://choosealicense.com/ seems like a good resource to review what you want others
>-and yourself- to be able to do with any code you write in the future.
